# Symbol mapping (special font for specified unicode code points). Map the

# in hexadecimal>. You can specify multiple code points, separated by commas
# and ranges separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple times.
# Syntax is:
#
# symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name

#symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A2,U+E0B0-U+E0B3 PowerlineSymbols
